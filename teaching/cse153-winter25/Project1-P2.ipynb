    "# IP Spoofing Proxy Lab using Scapy\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab provides a hands-on introduction to building a proxy server in Python that spoofs the source IP address of outgoing packets using the Scapy library. This demonstrates a fundamental technique used in various network attacks and security testing scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is IP Spoofing?\n",
    "\n",
    "IP spoofing is a technique where the source IP address in an IP packet is modified to a forged or fabricated address. This allows the sender to disguise their identity or impersonate another system. IP spoofing is often used in Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks, man-in-the-middle attacks, and other malicious activities.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a normal network communication, the source IP address in a packet identifies the sender. When IP spoofing is used, the recipient of the packet believes it originated from the spoofed IP address, not the actual sender.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a Proxy Server?\n",
    "\n",
    "A proxy server acts as an intermediary between a client and a server. When a client makes a request to a server, the request is first sent to the proxy server. The proxy server then forwards the request to the destination server on behalf of the client. The server's response is then sent back to the client through the proxy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Proxy servers can be used for various purposes, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Anonymity:** Hiding the client's IP address.\n",
    "*   **Caching:** Storing frequently accessed content to improve performance.\n",
    "*   **Content filtering:** Blocking access to certain websites or content.\n",
    "*   **Security:** Acting as a barrier against malicious traffic.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lab Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you will learn how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Craft and send IP packets with spoofed source IP addresses using Scapy.\n",
    "*   Implement a basic proxy server that forwards traffic and spoofs the source IP.\n",
    "*   Understand the mechanics of IP spoofing and its implications.\n",
    "*   Use a configuration file to manage proxy settings."
