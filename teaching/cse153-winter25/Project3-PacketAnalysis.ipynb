    "# Traffic Analysis Lab: OpenVPN and DNS with pypcap\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab provides a hands-on introduction to network traffic analysis using `pcap-ct` (or `pypcap`) and `dpkt` in Python. We will analyze a PCAP file containing OpenVPN and DNS traffic, extracting relevant information to answer specific questions about the network communication. `pcap-ct` works on windows prety well.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is pypcap and dpkt?\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **pypcap:** A Python interface to the libpcap packet capture library. It allows you to capture and read network traffic from live interfaces or PCAP files.\n",
    "*   **dpkt:** A fast, simple packet parsing library for Python. It can parse various network protocols, including IP, TCP, UDP, and DNS.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is OpenVPN?\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenVPN is a popular open-source VPN (Virtual Private Network) solution that creates secure point-to-point or site-to-site connections. It can use various protocols (UDP or TCP) and encryption algorithms to secure network traffic.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lab Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you will learn how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Read and parse PCAP files using `pcap-ct` (or `pypcap`) and `dpkt`.\n",
    "*   Extract information from OpenVPN and DNS packets.\n",
    "*   Understand the challenges of dissecting encrypted traffic.\n",
    "*   Use Python to analyze network traffic and answer specific questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Install required libraries:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    sudo apt install libpcap-dev  # Install libpcap development headers\n",
    "    pip3 install pcap-ct dpkt #(or `pypcap`)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Obtain a PCAP file:** You will need a PCAP file containing OpenVPN and DNS traffic. You can create one yourself using `tcpdump` or Wireshark, or use a sample PCAP file if provided for the lab. A good way to generate this pcap is to connect to a vpn server and then do some dns queries, then stop the capture.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lab Procedure\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Create the Python script:**\n",
    "If for any reason this strcture don't work for you, change all the code at your will."

    "\n",
    "*    Control Packet Types: What different control packet types were observed in the capture? (List the unique packet_type values). This can give you insights into the different stages of the OpenVPN connection (e.g., initial handshake, keep-alives, data channel establishment).\n",
    "\n",
    "*    Message ID Analysis: Are there any patterns in the message_id values? Are they sequential, random, or do they follow any other discernible pattern? This might reveal information about the communication flow between the client and server.\n",
    "\n",
    "*    Message Length Distribution: What is the distribution of message_length values for control packets? Are there any common sizes or outliers? This could indicate different types of control messages being exchanged.\n",
    "\n",
    "*    Correlating Control Packets: Can you identify pairs or sequences of control packets that seem to be related (e.g., a request followed by a response)? This requires analyzing the packet_type and potentially the message_id and timestamps. For example, a PUSH_REQUEST should be followed by a PUSH_REPLY.\n",
    "\n",
    "*    Timing Analysis of Control Packets: What is the time interval between consecutive control packets? Are there any periods of inactivity followed by bursts of control traffic? This could indicate connection maintenance or re-establishment attempts.\n",
    "\n",
    "*    (Even More Advanced - Requires more knowledge about OpenVPN internals - Huge bonus): If you can identify specific control packet types (by matching packet_type to known values from the OpenVPN source code or documentation), try to interpret the message_content (even in its hex form) based on the expected structure for that packet type. This is the closest you can get to actual payload analysis without decryption."
