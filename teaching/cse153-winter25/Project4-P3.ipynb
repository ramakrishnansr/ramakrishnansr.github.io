    "# Lab: Build a TOR-Like Server Node\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you will build server nodes that work together to create a TOR-like network. Each node will listen on a specific port, decrypt incoming packets, and forward them to the next node or send the actual request if it is the last node. The nodes will ensure secure and anonymous communication by encrypting and decrypting the data at each step.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Listening on a Specific Port**: Each node will listen on a designated port for incoming connections.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Receiving and Decrypting Packets**: When a node receives a connection, it will receive the packet and decrypt its layer of encryption.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Forwarding to the Next Node**: \n",
    "    - If the decrypted packet contains an IP address and port, the node will forward the remaining encrypted packet to the next node in the circuit.\n",
    "    - The packet forwarded will still be encrypted (it will be the second layer of encryption).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Sending the Actual Request**:\n",
    "    - If the node is the last in the circuit, upon decryption, it will reveal the actual HTTP request.\n",
    "    - The node will send the HTTP request to the target server and obtain the response.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Returning the Response**:\n",
    "    - The node will return the response to the parent node, encrypting it with the parent node's public key to maintain the security and anonymity of the communication. The response must follow the circuit until it gets to the client.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Listening on a Specific Port**:\n",
    "    - Set up each node to listen on a designated port for incoming connections.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Receiving and Decrypting Packets**:\n",
    "    - When a node receives a packet, it will decrypt its layer using its private key.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Forwarding to the Next Node**:\n",
    "    - If the decrypted packet contains an IP address and port, the node will forward the remaining encrypted packet to the next node in the circuit.\n",
    "    - Ensure the packet remains encrypted for the next node.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Sending the Actual Request**:\n",
    "    - If the node is the last in the circuit, it will decrypt the packet to reveal the HTTP request.\n",
    "    - Send the HTTP request to the target server and obtain the response.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Returning the Response**:\n",
    "    - Encrypt the response with the parent node's public key.\n",
    "    - Send the encrypted response back through the circuit to the client.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tips:\n",
    "\n",
    "Watchout with the lenght of the packets. Most encryption errors could be due this, so you'll maybe have to send and handle chunks. Every time the packet is encrypted, it's size will change"
