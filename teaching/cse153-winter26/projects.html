                <p>Welcome to Lab 1 of your Network Security class at UCSC! This lab is designed to immerse you in the practical aspects of network security by exploring and implementing various attacks over Layer 2 and Layer 3 protocols. This lab will guide you through the world of network vulnerabilities and the techniques used by attackers to exploit these weaknesses.</p>
                <p>In this lab, you will take on the role of a network attacker, learning and implementing different types of cyberattacks using Python. You will gain hands-on experience in executing Man-in-the-Middle (MiTM) attacks, evasion techniques to bypass security measures, and Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks to disrupt network services. By understanding and applying these attack methodologies, you will also learn the importance of securing networks against such threats.</p>
                <p>Through a series of exercises and projects, you will develop a deeper understanding of how these attacks work, how to detect them, and most importantly, how to defend against them. By the end of this lab, you will have gained valuable skills that will not only enhance your understanding of network security but also prepare you to design and implement robust security measures in real-world scenarios.</p>
				
				<h3>The Rules:</h3>
				<ul>
				<li>Do not talk about the hacking club. (No Copying! I've read all the code for this attacks that are on the Internet, i'll know!)</li>
				<li>Get into your team (max 3), each of you will have a specific role:
				<ul>
				<li>The spy: He'll be implementing a MiTM hacking software that intercepts and potentially modifies communication between two parties on a network. Essential tool for eavesdropping and intelligence, it will provide the team with internal information of our targets</li>
				<li>The Infiltrator: This operative specializes in the art of digital camouflage. Their expertise lies in manipulating network identifiers to mask their true origin and presence. Proficient in techniques such as IP spoofing, MAC address spoofing, and other evasion tactics, they navigate the digital landscape undetected, leaving no trace of their intrusion. They excel at bypassing basic security measures and creating decoys to divert attention from other operations. The Infiltrator ensures that the team's actions remain shrouded in secrecy, allowing for covert reconnaissance and exfiltration of sensitive data.</li>
				<li>The Disruptor:  This individual commands the power to disrupt and overwhelm network infrastructure. A master of denial-of-service attacks, they wield digital storms like SYN floods, UDP floods, and other disruptive techniques to cripple target systems. The Disruptor's role is to create diversions, disable critical services, or simply bring down the enemy's network, creating opportunities for the other team members to operate unimpeded. They understand the intricacies of network protocols and can orchestrate powerful attacks that leave their targets reeling.</li>

<p>Welcome back, initiates. Last time, you infiltrated networks, exploiting vulnerabilities and sowing digital chaos. Tonight, the tables turn. You'll transition from attacker to scanner to defender, learning the crucial skills necessary to scan and protect your systems and networks from the very techniques you mastered in Lab 1. This isn't just about patching holes; it's about building a robust, multi-layered defense – a digital fortress that can withstand even the most determined assaults.</p>

<p>This lab emphasizes a team-based approach to security. You'll collaborate, each taking on a specialized scanning and defensive role, mirroring the complex dynamics of real-world security teams. You'll learn to anticipate threats, implement preventative measures, detect intrusions, and respond effectively to security incidents. Remember the lessons you learned as attackers – understanding how an attack works is the first step to defending against it.</p>

<p>This lab also encompasses a <strong style="color:red">CTF (capture the flag)</strong>, where you're trying to get a secret clue about an attacker machine, located at cse153.ramakrishnansr.com (which the attacker has compromised and taken over a port). You'll need to work together to capture the flag, and turn over the secret to the authorities (the CSE 153 teaching team) so that they can apprehend the attacker.</p>

<h3>The Rules:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Do not talk about the hacking club. (No Copying! I've read all the code for this attacks that are on the Internet, i'll know!)</li>
    <li>Do NOT scan the server more than 20 times a day for the CTF. We have set up rate limits and your IP will be blocked and reported. A brute force scanning approach will NOT work, and is not an ethical security behavior. </li>

    <li>Get into your team (max 3), each of you will have a specific role:
        <ul>
            <li>The DNS Guardian: This role focuses on the overall security posture of the DNS environment, and monitors UDP flows. They are also a DNS wizard and can do DNS scans for finding attackers.</li>
            <li>The TCP Gatekeeper: This individual is responsible for securing the TCP layer and controlling network traffic. The Gatekeeper configures firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS), and other network security devices. They are also masters at developing TCP-based scanners (there are even rumors they are the inspiration for NMap).</li>
            <li>The Application Bodyguard: Experts at everything on the application layer. They are wizards at sending and reading HTTP requests, and are response for overall monitoring of the application system.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>If you are missing a member for any reason, do the tasks in order (it's okay to do half the CTF, just give us an idea of your progress). Each member is responsible for a task but EVERY member should help the others.</li>
    <li>For simplicity, try to pick classmates that have the same PC architecture (Intel or Mac). You'll have to deal with virtual machines and this will be very helpful!</li>
    <li>There are mandatory implementations. Non-mandatory implementations could give you extra points based on their difficulty. (Max 2 bonus implementations per group). </li>
    <li>You will be delivering:
        <ul>
            <li>The scanning code, CTF responses from the attacker machine, and the instructions and config files you use for defenses. The last could be a PDF or MD. For each defense, you have to pick one tool (e.g., Suricata). For non-mandatory/bonus ones say why you picked that tool (Especially if you are using a different tool than the suggested ones). Explain a use case of this tool and give your current configuration for that use case. You should answer all the Prometheus lab guide questions.</li>
            <li>A short video demonstrating your defenses in action (e.g., showing how your tools perform the scanning and defenses).</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>Let's build those digital walls and show those neighbors and attackers who's boss!</p>

                <h4 class="btn-link" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#part2-1">Part 1: The DNS Guardian's Vigil</h4>
                <div id="part2-1" class="collapse">
                    <p>The DNS Guardian establishes the foundation of the defensive strategy on DNS. Their vigilance ensures a strong baseline security posture.</p>
				<ul>

					<li><strong>DNS Scanner (<span style="color:red">CTF</span>) (Mandatory, <a href="./Project2-P1.ipynb">starter Jupyter notebook available</a>):</strong> Do you know what a CTF is? You have to capture (get or read in some sense) a hidden flag somewhere. Most of the time (and this is one of this times) it's not that easy, after you solve a clue, you'll get clues for the next one, and the next one and so on... So, your first clue is: Create a DNS request-response tool using SCAPY that can send DNS requests to <strong style="color:red;">cse153.ramakrishnansr.com</strong>. If you send the right (two) DNS queries, you will get both the IP address of the server the TCP Gatekeeper will use and a clue about which specific non-standard ports they need to scan. Hint: the <strong style="color:red;">T</strong>ext you find in DNS will be e<strong style="color:red;">X</strong>tremely useful in revealing the <strong style="color:red;">T</strong>ruth.</li>
					<li><strong>Log Analysis (Mandatory, see tools section: Prometheus):</strong> Configure logging and analysis tools to detect patterns indicative of DoS attacks (e.g., high volumes of UDP or TCP packets on specific ports, this is very common with DNS because there is no handshale). This involves analyzing system logs, network device logs, and potentially using dedicated network monitoring tools. To test Prometheus, send traffic from the DNS scanner or ACK flooding (project 1) to the victim machine at a really high rate.</li>
				</ul>
				<p><strong>Bonus Points (The Guardian):</strong> Set up 2 local DNS server (e.g., using dnsmasq) that serves a single domain. This adds a layer of control over DNS resolution and can be used to detect DNS-based attacks or malicious DNS queries. (Both DNS servers could be equal)</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="project-part">
                <h4 class="btn-link" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#part2-2">Part 2: The TCP Gatekeeper's Fortress</h4>
                <div id="part2-2" class="collapse">
                    <p>The Gatekeeper controls the flow of TCP traffic in and out of the network, acting as the first line of defense against external threats. But a strong defender is a strong counter-attacker, and the TCP Gatekeeper needs to find what port the attacker is using at <strong style="color:red;">cse153.ramakrishnansr.com</strong>.</p>
			<ul>
                
                <li><strong>SYN Scanner (<span style="color:red">CTF</span>) (Mandatory, <a href="./Project2-P2.ipynb">starter Jupyter notebook available</a>):</strong> Now that you have the clue of which ports to scan from the DNS Gatekeeper, implement a TCP SYN scanner (similar to NMap) that will send a SYN packet to each port in the desired range, looking for SYN-ACK packets that indicates an open port. Make sure you follow ethical scanning behavior (close open connections, follow rate limits) -- If you scan the server too many times continuously, you will be rate-limited by the attacker and will not get the correct results. You need to communicate the open port to the Application Bodyguard so that they can finish the CTF. 
				<li><strong>Port Scanning Detection/Prevention (Mandatory, see tools section: Suricata (You can use Snort too)):</strong> Configure firewalls and IDS/IPS to detect and block port scanning activity. For testing, use the port scanning tool you developed in the CTF and try to port scan your NIDS instance.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Bonus Points (The Gatekeeper):</strong> Implement measures to prevent and detect various DoS attacks (SYN floods, UDP floods, Smurf attacks) using your defense system (Suricata). This includes configuring firewalls for rate limiting, SYN cookies, and other mitigation techniques, as well as configuring IDS/IPS rules to detect DoS attack patterns.</li>

                <div id="part2-3" class="collapse">
                    <p>The Bodyguard focuses on securing individual hosts and applications, defending against web application attacks. They are the last line of defense, protecting critical assets even if the network perimeter is breached.</p>
		<ul>
            <li><strong>HTTP Scanner (<span style="color:red">CTF</span>) (Mandatory, <a href="./Project2-P3.ipynb">starter Jupyter notebook available</a>):</strong>Now that you know the open port from the SYN scanner, use Scapy to send a HTTP get request to the open port at <strong style="color:red;">cse153.ramakrishnansr.com's</strong> IP address. The response you get will give clues about how to modify your request so that ultimately, you can capture the flag!. 
		</ul>
        <p><strong>Bonus Points (The Bodyguard):</strong>Application Monitoring:</strong>Set up a Prometheus instance (see tools section) to monitor the traffic to a web service protected by the Bodyguard's configurations. This allows for real-time monitoring of traffic patterns and can help detect anomalies or attacks targeting the web application. Explain what you see.

                    <li>Get into your team (max 3), each of you will have a specific role:
                        <ul>
                            <li>The Analyst (Traffic Review): This role focuses on analyzing network traffic to identify patterns, extract information, and understand communication flows. They are proficient in using packet capture tools and protocol dissectors to dissect network traffic and uncover hidden details.</li>
                            <li>The Profiler (Fingerprinting): This role specializes in techniques used to create unique digital fingerprints of users and devices. They understand how various data points, such as browser settings, operating system details, and network configurations, can be combined to create a fingerprint that can be used to track individuals across the web.</li>
                            <li>The Cookie Master (Web Privacy): This role focuses on the intricacies of web privacy, particularly concerning cookies and other tracking mechanisms used by websites. They understand how cookies work, how they are used to track users, and the techniques used to mitigate tracking and enhance web privacy.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>If you are missing a member for any reason, do the tasks in order. Each member is responsible for a task but EVERY member should help the others.</li>
                    <li>There are mandatory implementations. Non-mandatory implementations could give you extra points based on their difficulty. (Max 2 bonus implementations per group)</li>
                    <li>You will be delivering:
                        <ul>

                            <li>The code or configuration files you made</li>
                            <li>A short video demonstrating your lab in action (e.g., showing how your tools detect or prevent an attack).</li>

                <div id="part3-1" class="collapse">
                    <p>The Analyst delves into the raw data of network communication, extracting insights and revealing hidden information using the powerful network security monitor Zeek.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Zeek Installation and Configuration:</strong> Install and configure Zeek to monitor network traffic. This involves setting up Zeek to capture traffic from a network interface or from a PCAP file. (Mandatory - <a href="./ZeekLab.md">Lab available</a>)</li>
                        <li><strong>Basic Zeek Scripting and Log Analysis:</strong> Write basic Zeek scripts to extract specific information from network traffic, such as visited websites, DNS queries, HTTP requests, and other relevant data. Analyze the Zeek logs to identify potential privacy leaks and suspicious activity. The focus should be on logs related to HTTP, DNS, and SSL/TLS. Follow the lab guideline for this. (Mandatory - <a href="./ZeekLab.md">Lab available, Complete Lab Questions, it's the same lab</a>)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Bonus Points (Difficulty: 7):</strong> Develop a custom Zeek script that detects specific privacy-related events, such as connections to known tracking servers or the transmission of sensitive data in cleartext. For Bonus Points, a minimum of 5 types of events should be detected with an explanation on how it is related to privacy and/or network security.</p>

                <div id="part3-2" class="collapse">
                    <p>The Profiler constructs unique digital fingerprints, revealing the subtle traces that users leave behind as they navigate the digital world. This part of the lab will explore different fingerprinting techniques and their effectiveness.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Browser Fingerprinting:</strong> Analyze pcaps with http queries and tell what browser is generating it. This is called browser fingerprinting. To do this, you must analyze how different browsers query the same webpage and compare the uniqueness of the fingerprint with others. We provide some pcaps taken from different browsers. Obviously saying "because the User-Agent header says so" will have no value. Try to figure out other differences, use pcaps of your own browser (or tools) if needed (Mandatory - <a href="./browser-pcaps.zip">Pcaps available</a>)</li>
                        <li><strong>Device Fingerprinting:</strong> Analyze a device fingerprinting tool that collects information about the user's device based on pcap captures. You certainly can spot the differences between OS's by looking at the network stack, and even between different versions of the OS. Analyze the collected data to identify unique patterns that can be used to track the device across different networks. (Mandatory -  <a href="./browser-pcaps.zip">Pcaps available, same as the last ones</a>). </li>
                        <li><strong>DNS and OpenVPN traffic analysis:</strong> Analyze the DNS queries and OpenVPN traffic to identify patterns that can be used for fingerprinting. This could involve looking at the DNS queries made by different devices or analyzing the OpenVPN handshake to extract unique identifiers. (Mandatory - <a href="./Project3-PacketAnalysis.ipynb" download>Jupyter Notebook available</a>, <a href="./dns-openvpn-pcaps.zip">Pcaps available</a>)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Bonus Points (Difficulty: 5):</strong>  Generate pcaps of different versions of the same OS and identify those versions using just network traffic (e.g: ubuntu 18 vs ubuntu 24). Give 2 different OS-version analysis (4 pcaps in total)</p>
                    <p><strong>Bonus Points (Difficulty: 10)+:</strong> There's a huge bonus in traffic analysis lab (at the end of the Python notebook). You need to create more traffic on your own.</p>

                    <p>The Cookie Master understands the hidden world of web tracking, controlling the flow of information between users and websites.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Coding extensions for privacy:</strong> Develop a browser extension that provides advanced cookie management features, such as automatic cookie deletion, whitelisting, and the ability to view and modify cookie content in real-time. This could also include features to prevent other tracking techniques like local storage or canvas fingerprinting. (<a href="./ChromeExtensionACM.zip">Base code available</a>, tested under windows but should work with every OS)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Bonus Points (Difficulty: 10):</strong> Work with the Spy and using an ARP spoofing attack, fetch the cookies from the traffic of a victim, save them on a file and make your browser extension replace your actual cookies with your victim cookies.</p>
