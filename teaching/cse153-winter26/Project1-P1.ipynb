    "## What is ARP Spoofing?\n",
    "\n",
    "ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) Spoofing is a type of cyber attack where an attacker sends falsified ARP messages over a local network. This results in the linking of the attacker's MAC address with the IP address of a legitimate computer or server on the network. Once the attacker’s MAC address is associated with an authentic IP address, the attacker can receive any data intended for that IP address. This can lead to various malicious activities such as man-in-the-middle attacks, data interception, and session hijacking.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lab Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we are going to implement a tool to perform ARP Spoofing. This will help you understand the mechanics of the attack and the potential security implications. You will learn how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Craft and send ARP packets\n",
    "- Redirect network traffic\n",
    "- Analyze the impact of ARP Spoofing on network communication\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lab, you will have a practical understanding of ARP Spoofing and the importance of securing networks against such attacks."
